# cleanup-bash-scripts

This repository aims to provide the community with a series of bash scripts for cleaning up unused resources.

#### Available scripts
* AWS
    * [Unused security groups](/security_groups/README.md)
        
#### AWS to do list
- iam_policy
- iam_role
- iam_user
- iam_access_key
- ebs_volume
- friend
- launch_configuration
- lb
- lb_listener
- elb
etc

At first I'm starting with AWS but nothing prevents us from adding other cloud providers.

Any help is welcome!
